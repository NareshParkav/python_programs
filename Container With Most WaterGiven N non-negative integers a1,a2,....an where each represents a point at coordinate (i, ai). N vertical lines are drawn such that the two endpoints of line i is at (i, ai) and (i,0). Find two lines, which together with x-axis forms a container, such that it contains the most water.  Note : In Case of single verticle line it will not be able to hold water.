//Container With Most Water
//Given N non-negative integers a1,a2,....an where each represents a point at coordinate (i, ai). N vertical lines are drawn such that the two endpoints of line i is at (i, ai) and (i,0). Find two lines, which together with x-axis forms a container, such that it contains the most water.

//Note : In Case of single verticle line it will not be able to hold water.
